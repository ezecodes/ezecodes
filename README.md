## 🚀 What I Do

Enabling teams to deliver and maintain production-grade systems via:

- ⚡ **High-throughput Go & Node.js backends**
- 🏗 **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform, Docker, CI/CD
- 🔒 **Security & reliability**: mTLS, Policy-as-code, monitoring, and observability
- 💳 **Payment systems**, internal tooling, and infrastructure automation
- 🛠️ **Developer platforms**: tools that make teams 10x faster

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- 🚀 *Ship small, ship often.* Fast feedback beats perfect code.
- 🛡 *Build for edge cases first.* If it works only in ideal conditions, it’s useless.
- 🧩 *Keep it simple.* Complexity is the enemy of reliability.
- 📊 *Learn from production.* Logs, metrics, and incidents are your teachers.
