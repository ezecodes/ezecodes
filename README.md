### ğŸ›  Principles

- ğŸš€ **Ship small, ship often.** Fast feedback beats perfect code.  
- ğŸ›¡ **Build for edge cases first;** if it works only in ideal conditions, itâ€™s useless.  
- ğŸ§© **Keep it simple;** complexity is the enemy of reliability.  
- ğŸ“Š **Learn from production;** logs, metrics, and incidents are your teachers.
