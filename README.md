# ⚙️ Jah Ez — Engineering Reliable Systems at Scale

Hi, I’m Elijah, a fullstack engineer and devops specialist. I build high-performance systems with clean, reliable infrastructure, designed to scale from zero to millions of users.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

I help teams build and operate production-grade systems with:

- ⚡ **High-throughput Go & Node.js backends**
- 🏗 **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform, Docker, CI/CD
- 🔒 **Security & reliability**: mTLS, Policy-as-code, monitoring, and observability
- 💳 **Payment systems**, internal tooling, and infrastructure automation
- 🛠️ **Developer platforms**: tools that make teams 10x faster

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- 🚀 *Ship small, ship often.* Fast feedback beats perfect code.
- 🛡 *Build for edge cases first.* If it works only in ideal conditions, it’s useless.
- 🧩 *Keep it simple.* Complexity is the enemy of reliability.
- 📊 *Learn from production.* Logs, metrics, and incidents are your teachers.
